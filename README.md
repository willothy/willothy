Hi, I'm willothy

I like Neovim, compilers, distributed systems and Rust.

I write lots of Rust at @freestyle-sh.

In my free time I build Neovim plugins. I mostly build them for my own personal
use - I build things that I need - but I document and maintain them for anyone
to use. I also contribute to Neovim core, mainly in the areas of window management and the C API.
