Hi, I'm willothy

I like Neovim, compilers, distributed systems and Rust.

I write lots of Rust at @freestyle-sh.

In my free time I build Neovim plugins. I mostly build them for my own personal
use - I build things that I need - but I document and maintain them for anyone
to use. I also contribute to Neovim core, mainly in the areas of window management and the C API.

My actively maintained plugins:

- [flatten.nvim](https://github.com/willothy/flatten.nvim)
- [nvim-cokeline](https://github.com/willothy/nvim-cokeline)
- [wezterm.nvim](https://github.com/willothy/wezterm.nvim)
- [durable.nvim](https://github.com/willothy/durable.nvim)
- [savior.nvim](https://github.com/willothy/savior.nvim)
- [strat-hero.nvim](https://github.com/willothy/strat-hero.nvim)
- [judge.lua](https://github.com/willothy/judge.lua)
